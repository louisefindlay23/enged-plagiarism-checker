# Engineering Education Plagiarism Checker

Engineering Education Plagiarism Checker provides a web application where Peer Reviewers and Content Moderators of Section's Engineering Education programme can enter a GitHub Pull Request number and the raw title of the Markdown file will be downloaded and scanned through the CopyLeaks API. 

Once a report has been generated, the report will be posted as an attachment to the GitHub Pull Request.

Automating plagiarism checks saves time and allows more articles to be reviewed.
